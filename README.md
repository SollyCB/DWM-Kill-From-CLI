## Kill DWM from terminal

My laptop does not have an easy way to get to a login screen when using dwm.

This program kills the dwm process using its process ID, this likely is different depending on the 
PC, (idk if window manager always starts as specific process, I doubt it) but it always works 
for my laptop, so I'm saving it here.
